Features: 

1) Checks all ports of a basic logic ic (AND , OR, NOT, NOR, NAND, XOR gates) and detects the specific ic and show whether all the ports are okay or whether the ic is damaged. There are 3 slots for placing ICs to check as all basic ic pin configurations are not the same.

2) The output ( either the ic name , or if damaged displays damaged) is shown in a LCD displau

3) The output is then transmitted as msg to a phone number via Sim800L module

** Both hardware and software simulations were done.
